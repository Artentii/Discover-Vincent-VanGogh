            Van Gogh's travels and experiences were crucial to the development of his unique artistic style. His use of color and brushwork was heavily influenced by the landscapes and cultures he
            encountered, and his work continues to inspire and captivate viewers to this day.

                Van Gogh moved to Paris in 1886 and was heavily influenced by the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, particularly the works of Claude Monet and Georges Seurat. He began
                experimenting with brighter colors and more expressive brushstrokes, and his work became more vibrant and lively.

                nature, and his work during this period often features swirling, organic forms and rich, natural colors.
