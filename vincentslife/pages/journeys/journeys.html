          Van Gogh's travels and experiences were crucial to the development of his unique artistic style. His use of color and brushwork was heavily influenced by the landscapes and cultures he
          encountered, and his work continues to inspire and captivate viewers to this day.

              He was heavily influenced by the landscape and the people around him. He frequently painted peasant laborers and rural scenes, and his use of dark, earthy colors reflects the Dutch

              He was exposed to the work of contemporary artists like Millet and Rembrandt while at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He experimented with different techniques and styles during this
              time, and his work began to take on a more somber tone.

              Van Gogh moved to Paris in 1886 and was heavily influenced by the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, particularly the works of Claude Monet and Georges Seurat. He began
              experimenting with brighter colors and more expressive brushstrokes, and his work became more vibrant and lively.

              He moved to Arles seeking warmer weather and brighter light. He was deeply inspired by the landscape and the vibrant colors of the Mediterranean, and his work during this period is

              Van Gogh voluntarily committed himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in 1889, where he continued to paint prolifically. He was surrounded by gardens and nature, and his work during
              this period often features swirling, organic forms and rich, natural colors.

              He moved to Auvers-sur-Oise where he was drawn to the pastoral landscapes and the simple way of life there, and his work during this period features many views of the town and the
              surrounding countryside. However, he also struggled with mental illness and took his own life in July of that year.
